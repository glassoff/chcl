  This issue was *not* due to the implmentation of MIME in Swift -

 8th June 2006: 1.2.0
 Ermmm.. Oops, the 1.1.3 release was actually 7th June 2006.
 Moving on Swiftly (no pun intended)....
 Some speed/memory improvements by removing some preg_ calls
 that were used several times.
 Added setPriority() and requestReadReceipt() methods.
 Added a check to make sure close() isn't executed if Swift
 is not connected.
 Improved error reporting a little further.
 Bundled a verbose errors plugin (Swift_Errors_Plugin).

 22nd June 2006: 1.2.3
 Corrected a bug with TLS on Gmail servers.  Thanks to Jonathon Foote
 and Andres Usera for spotting the issue and offering a fix.
 The problem was that Gmail, operating with TLS enabled does not respond to the
 QUIT command so fgets() was giving TLS protocol errors.  A simple @ supression
 combined with boolean false return check corrected this.

 24th June 2006: 1.3.0
 Corrected a bug in the makeSafe() method.
 Optimized makeSafe() by calling LFtoCRLF() before processing.
 Added 8bit and binary encoding types.
 Default to 8bit transfer encoding with UTF-8.
 Added VERSION constant.
 Added ability to override plugin names at load-time.
 Restricted size of "transactions" array to 100 by default, settable
 using setMaxLogSize().
 Massively optimized buildMail() (Half the memory!)
